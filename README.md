healthpages
===========

A simple application to find and rate doctors in Taiwan. You can add additional doctor's information
and leave comments for each doctor.

The data is stored in a [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com) database and for
the frontend AngularJS 1.3.x is used.

To see the application running please visit:
[Healthpages](https://healthpages.firebaseapp.com)

I mostly wrote the app to play around with Firebase and AngularJS.
Have fun improving and using it, it is licensed under MIT license.

To build it on your local system, make sure you installed 
[yo](http://yeoman.io), [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt) and [bower](http://bower.io/).

Then call the following commands in your command line:

1. `sudo npm install` - to make sure node modules are installed
1. `bower update` - to get the app's dependencies
1. `grunt server` - to run the app on a local grunt server
